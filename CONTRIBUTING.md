# Contributing to Guess That Pokemon
I welcome all bug fixes.

If you want to add a new feature please contact me. We can talk over what is being added. I am open to ideas to make the game more fun and interactive.
If you have an improvement to performance or code, please let me know. I am always open to learning and improving my skills.

## Design standards
Please try to follow current design patterns. I would hate to deny something that took a long time to create.

Some examples to design by:

### 1. Limited text
Limiting text helps the user focus on the grid and game itself. I did a bare minimum design just to get the game up and running. If you wish to redesign the game that
is perfectly fine. Just do not clutter the page with text, buttons, popups, etc.

### 2. Color
This plays into the first point. Keep the theme dark unless you are making a theme toggle. Keep buttons red and text white.

### 3. Limit clicks
When adding new features try to think if it's a tedious process. To access the Pokedex it should be 1 click. Not a series of menus in a hidden tab somwhere.

## Code Standards
I'm not the perfect coder but keeping things consistent is helpful to everyone. Also documenting variables correctly keeps everything clean. Im open to changes in code
to make it more manageable.

### 1. Variable and function names
Try to give functions and variables meaningful names.

NOT good
```
let newVar = 'Weedle'
```

GOOD
```
let correctAnswer = 'Weedle'
```

### 2. Comments
It's always nice to leave comments on complicated sections of code. A quick reference to what a section of code does never hurts. Avoid leaving paragraphs, but leave
needed information.

## Commit messages
### 1. If you are not adding a new feature or any functionality changes, leave the word 'REFACTOR' or something similar.

### 2. Your commit should also say what is being done. How the problem or feature was done can be left for an additional message in your commit.
