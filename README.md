# Guess That Pokemon!

### Description
This project is a simple guessing game. An image will appear on the grid. Using your keyboard or the interactive digital keyboard you can submit your answer.  Random tiles will be hidden, making the image harder to guess. Afer each guess the tiles will randomize again giving you a better chance. Once you guess the correct name of the Pokemon, you will be prompted with a "play again" screen.

This project took me a little over 1 week to make. I worked on and off of the project in my free time.
